# Champlain API
We're building an open API for our school to allow for a centralized development experience.

## What are we hoping to add?
* Courses - Retrieves available courses for the semester
* Course Details - Fetches specific course details, including faculty and syllabus
* Faculty Directory - Lists faculty members, their departments, and contact information
* Campus Events - Lists upcoming campus events, workshops, and club meetings
* Dining Menu -	Provides daily menus for dining halls
* Library Resources - Enables searching for books and resources in the library
